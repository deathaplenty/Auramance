This measures a persons ability to resist temptation, resist control effects, and keep their morale in the face of danger. At higher levels, the character may sometimes refuse to die (Save vs death).

## For every point of Spirit
- -1 to save vs Charm (Default 17)
- -1 to save vs Demoralize (Default 20)
- -1 to save vs Toxin (Default 18)

## For every point of Spirit over 5
- you get -1 modifier to save vs death (Example: default save vs death roll check is 21. This means it is impossible to succeed by default. If you have 7 spirit, you subtract 2 from 21, which is 19. You can now roll a 19 or 20 and not die.)
