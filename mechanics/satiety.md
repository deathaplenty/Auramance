Adventurers have to eat. Satiety is a measure of how well your metabolic needs are met, such as food and water.

# Notable Levels
- 100: Full satiety. You could not be any more sated.
- 75:  Hungry. Your stomach has let you know that it's ready for input.
- 50:  Famished. It's probably been a day since you've had food.
- 0:   Starving. Your body has started consuming itself to keep important functions active.


# Using Satiety
Characters shouldn't start taking damage until satiety is zero. After that, a reasonable rate of health loss might be 1 point of health per 25 satiety the player would have lost over time. This means that if 50 satiety is 24 hours without food, then a player will lose 2 health a day. Extrapolating further, you can expect a human that had full health to die after 12 days of not having food.

GMs can feel free to make strenuous tasks drain satiety. Climbing mountains is sure to make an adventurer hungry.

# Natural Regeneration
If natural regeneration is preferred in your session, you could allow regeneration between 100 and 50 satiety. Realistic natural regeneration would probably be extremely slow, however.
