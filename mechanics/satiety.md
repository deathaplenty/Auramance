Adventurers have to eat. Satiety is a measure of how well your metabolic needs are met, such as food and water.

## Using Satiety
Satiety drains at a rate of 4 per day or 1 per 6 hours. Therfor, a character that had full satiety will be at 50 satiety after 12 and a half days, and at 0 satiety after 25 days. This means a character typically starts starving a little after two days without food.

Characters shouldn't start taking damage until satiety is zero. After that, a reasonable rate of health loss might be 1 point of health per 25 satiety the character would have lost over time. This means that every 25 hours, the character would lose 2 health. Extrapolating further, you can expect a human that had full health to die after 12 and a half days of not having food.

These debuffs will affect all derivatives. You will become encumbered as you weaken. You will forget things as your memory lapses. You will be more susceptible to negative effects as your body cannot fight them as well.

**A Note to GMs**

You can easily tweak how fast or slow starvation happens by tweaking how much satiety is lost per day.

You could also use satiety as a type of currency for strenuous tasks. Climbing mountains is sure to make an adventurer hungry.

## Natural Regeneration
If natural regeneration is preferred in your session, a good range for this would probably be 100 inclusive to 80 exclusive.

## Developer Notes
The intention behind this mechanic is to add realism to an adventure and to make pre-adventure preparation and survival skills important.
