The Aura is an atmosphere of magic. Entities can draw upon this energy, and the Aura will replenish itself naturally over time.

## Game Rules
### Entering an Area
Roll 1d20 for current Aura level

### Maximum
maximum is always 20, unless the DM wants to change it, perhaps for a story-driven reason.
If the current Aura is 0, a random ethereal Fae will be damaged if a spell is cast.

### Aura Regeneration
Aura Regeneration is a fixed value based on moon phase.

|Moon Phase    |Regeneration Value|
|--:           |:--       |
|New Moon      |0         |
|Crescent Moon |1         |
|Half Moon     |2         |
|Gibbous Moon  |3         |
|Full Moon     |4         |

Aura regeneration happens at the end of every round (everyone has had a turn).

### Casting from the Aura
You can always cast a spell, even if Aura is at zero. However, for every point of magic used that isn't in the Aura, etherial creatures will take damage. Each point is distributed semi-randomly, starting from a random value, then going in order. Etherial creatures damaged this way will be upset and will be on their way to do harm to you.

### Aura Overtax Damage
To do overtax damage to ethereals, first assign numbers to your ethereal party members starting from 1. Roll a d10. Starting at that value, apply 1 point of damage for every entity in ascending order, wrapping back to 1 if necessary, until you run out of damage to deal. For empty values, generate new ethereals, assign them that value, then damage them.
