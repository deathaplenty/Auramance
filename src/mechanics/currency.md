The most widely accepted currency is a form of unmarked gold coin that is shaped like a flat hexagon that has had weak points stamped into it to allow it to be broken into 6 smaller triangular units. These coins have no value beyond their intrinsic gold value.

It is impossible to counterfeit one of these coins, but it is possible to make non-gold coins that look and feel like the real thing, and it is possible to shave some weight off of a gold coin in order to lessen the cost when buying with it. Of course, these shady things are morally wrong and people might catch you.
