Inventory has two limiting factors: weight and volume. Since it's bad enough having to keep track of a total weight, we'll use inventory slots as a simplification of volume.

# Carry Weight
As stated, this is determined solely by your character's strength. It is the amount of weight you can carry without being slowed down. This also includes anything you are wearing, so wearing heavy plate armor will reduce the total amount of weight you can carry.

# Inventory Slots
There are 10 inventory slots that each item fits nicely into. For some items, it wouldn't make sense to have them take a whole slot (rings for example). For those items which are trivial to keep on your person, they can simply add their weight without taking up a spot. Item pages will usually list their properties, including weight and whether they take up a slot.
