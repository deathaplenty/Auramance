Saving throws are checks to specifically avoid some outcome. The number by each type is the default check.

## Save vs Death (21)
Any time a character would take lethal damage, they may make a saving throw vs death. If it is successful, the character is reduced to 1 health. If it is unsuccessful, the user takes damage as normal.

### Affected by
- Body and Spirit
  - Subtract the floored average of these two stats from the base (21)


## Save vs Charm (17)
Any time a character would be controlled by an outside force, they may make a saving throw vs charm. If it is successful, control is not lost.

### Affected by
- Spirit
  - Subtract this stat from the base (17)


## Save vs Toxin (18)
Any time a character would be infected with a toxic agent, be it venom or poison, they may make a saving throw vs toxin. If it is successful, they resist the toxin.

### Affected by
- Body
  - Subtract this stat from the base (18)

## Save vs Burning (11)
Any time a character is on fire, they may make a saving throw vs burning. If it is successful, they do not stay on fire. If it is not successful, they take damage and must try to roll next turn to put the flames out.

### Affected by
- Equipment


## Save vs Demoralize (20)
Any time a character would lose their ability of rational thought (fear, panic, etc), they may make a saving throw vs demoralize. If it is successful, they shrug off those feelings of fear or panic.

## Save vs Sleep(2)
This check heavily depends on how tired the character is. For every hour after 8 waking hours, this check increases by one. If this check were to go past 20, the character loses consciousness and falls asleep. This happens at 27 hours awake.
