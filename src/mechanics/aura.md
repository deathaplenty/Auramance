The Aura is an atmosphere of magic. Entities can draw upon this energy, and the Aura will replenish itself naturally over time.

## Game Rules
### Entering an Area
Roll 1d20 for current Aura level

### Maximum
maximum is always 20, unless the GM wants to change it, perhaps for a story-driven reason.

### Aura Regeneration
Aura Regeneration is a fixed value based on moon phase.

|Moon Phase    |Regeneration Value|
|--:           |:--       |
|New Moon      |0         |
|Crescent Moon |1         |
|Half Moon     |2         |
|Gibbous Moon  |3         |
|Full Moon     |4         |

Aura regeneration happens every in game hour.

### Casting from the Aura
You can always cast a spell, even if Aura is at zero. However, for every point of mana used that isn't in the Aura, the character will take that much damage.

### Dangers of drawing from the Aura
Some Fae don't like it when people draw from the Aura. Each area should have a Fae threat level from 1 to 20. When a character rolls for Auramancy, if that roll is below the threat level, a random Fae creature should attack.
