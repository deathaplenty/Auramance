The Aura is an atmosphere of magic. Entities can draw upon this energy, and the Aura will replenish itself naturally over time.

## Game Rules
### Entering an Area
Roll 1d20 for current Aura level

### Maximum
maximum is always 20, unless the GM wants to change it, perhaps for a story-driven reason.

### Aura Regeneration
Aura Regeneration is a fixed value based on moon phase.

|Moon Phase    |Regeneration Value|
|--:           |:--       |
|New Moon      |0         |
|Crescent Moon |1         |
|Half Moon     |2         |
|Gibbous Moon  |3         |
|Full Moon     |4         |

Aura regeneration happens every in game hour.

### Casting from the Aura
You can always cast a spell, even if Aura is at zero. However, for every point of mana used that isn't in the Aura, the character will take that much damage.

### Dangers of taxing the Aura
Some Fae don't like it when an entity drains the Aura. Some specifically dislike it when the Aura is driven below a value. Others dislike any Aura use at all. If some of these Fae are nearby, they will attack the caster if the criteria are met.
