Adventurers have to eat. Satiety is a measure of how well your metabolic needs are met, such as food and water.

## Using Satiety
Satiety drains at a rate of 4 per day or 1 per 6 hours. Therfor, a character that had full satiety will be at 50 satiety after 12 and a half days, and at 0 satiety after 25 days. After a character falls below 80 satiety, negative effects start stacking against them.

These debuffs will affect all derivatives. The character will become encumbered as they weaken, forget things as their memory lapses, and be more susceptible to negative effects as their body cannot fight them as well.

|Satiety|Effects                                          |

**A Note to GMs**

You can easily tweak how fast or slow starvation happens by tweaking how much satiety is lost per day.

You could also use satiety as a type of currency for strenuous tasks. Climbing mountains is sure to make an adventurer hungry.

## Natural Regeneration
If natural regeneration is preferred in your session, a good range for this would probably be 100 inclusive to 80 exclusive.

## Developer Notes
The intention behind this mechanic is to add realism to an adventure and to make pre-adventure preparation and survival skills important.
