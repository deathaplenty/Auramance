## Lore
Elves do not generally care for other humanoid species. During the rise of humans in the northern forests, elves chose to distance themselves and relocated to a desert oasis near the equator. Elves are still fair-skinned despite their desert habitat due to their genetic approach to preventing harmful sun damage. An Elf's skin is naturally reflective of high frequency light, giving them a very slight blue-violet tint over their alabaster skin tone.
