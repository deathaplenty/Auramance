Demons and Angels are the same thing. They are a type of Fae brought about from strong emotion. They typically have an affinity for whatever emotion bore them, causing many demons and angels to be slaves to emotions that are not their own.

###Ethereal
  - Cannot be harmed by physical damage
  - Lose life if Aura is overtaxed
  - Cannot equip anything but items in the hands
  - Cannot hold an inventory

###Corporeal

## Affinity
Demons and Angels can have an affinity toward the following emotions and ideals:


| Affinity | Effect |
| --:      |:--     |
|Envy      | Choose a type of item. If an entity has that item, you are aware of it. You must retrieve that item from the entity in some way.|
|Greed     | You can sense gold nearby and know when an entity is carrying it. Bonus damage against characters that are carrying gold. |
|Hate      | Choose some group. This character hates members of that group. Bonus damage taken and received from those group members. This character must attack members of that group.  |
|Love      | Cannot inflict harm. Starts with a healing spell. Cannot self-heal with spells. |
|Lust      | This character cannot resist charm. Targets cannot resist charm (Doesn't effect targets that cannot be charmed). This character has a natural charm that can be used once per day. |
|Pride     | Choose a skill. If an entity challenges you in this skill in some way, you gain +1 to that skill during the contest.  |
|Sloth     | Skip every other turn. Reduce damage taken by half.  |
|Justice   | If someone isn't conforming to your sense of righteousness, correct it. |
|Wrath     | Doubles damage taken and received. |
|Apathy    | Character cannot be bothered to care about anything.  |
|Guardian  | Choose another player character. When protecting that character, the guardian gets -4 to save vs death. Guardian must protect that character when possible.|


Each affinity should change gameplay in some way.

Players can make spirit rolls to attempt to resist their affinity effect for 24 hours. The check is (22 - spirit). A character with max spirit chooses when the effect takes place (can't toggle during combat).

If gameplay effects aren't preffered, treat these affinities as a roleplay guide/alignment. If you are just using these for roleplay, feel free to make your affinity any strong emotion or ideal you can think of.
