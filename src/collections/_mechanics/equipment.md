Equipment refers to the things the character is wearing, things like armor and weapons. Equipment is plainly visible on characters.

# Equipment Slots
- Armor: Where most of the protection is calculated from
- Gloves: Protects hands from dangerous stuff or rough surfaces
- Boots: Protects feet from dangerous floor hazards
- Magic Ring: actually hidden if you have gloves on.
- Left Hand
- Right Hand

I feel that having the equipment broken down to the point of including the legs, the shoulder pads, etc, just complicates the system. Besides, you typically buy or find a whole set of armor
