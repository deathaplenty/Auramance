Criticals are the offensive counterpart of the counterattack. If the difference of a contest is greater than 15 in the attacker's favor, the attacker rolls twice for damage.

### Notable Case
If the defender has a skill modifier advantage of 4 over the attacker, the attacker can never critically hit.
