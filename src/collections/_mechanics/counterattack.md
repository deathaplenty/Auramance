A character may counterattack if they are the defender and they win the contest against the attacker with a difference of scores higher than 15.


### Example
- Attacker rolls a 2 + 2 one-hand skill = 4
- Defender rolls a 17 + 4 evasion skill = 21
- The difference between these scores is 17, therefor, the defender may counterattack

### How to roll for a counterattack
So you've gotten the opportunity to counterattack, but how do you go about applying that counterattack?

- Choose your attack
- Roll a d20 and apply your skill modifiers
- If you roll higher than 10, you successfully counterattack
- Roll for damage

### Notable Case
If the attacker has a skill modifier advantage of 4 over the defender, the defender can never counterattack.
