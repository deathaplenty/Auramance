There are times during an adventure where one's strength of spirit will be tested. Some of these times are listed below.

## A character is dealt damage equal to half or more of their current health
When a character is dealt a major blow they are quickly made aware of how mortal they really are. Any time a character would lose half of their current health in one turn, they may panic or run in fear. This means that the lower the character's health is, the more likely a blow will break their morale.

## A character is at or below 25% health
It is hard to think straight when you are suffering from severe blood loss. At the end of every turn, if a character is close to death, they may panic.

## A character is under some magical or chemical effect
Sometimes a character may eat the wrong kind of mushroom or maybe be the target of an illusory spell. Spell and consumable effects may rob a character of their rational thinking
