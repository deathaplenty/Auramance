This measures a character's ability to utilize energy from the Aura. Non-Fae characters may only ever have a zero for this skill, preventing aura use. Fae characters have a default of one for this skill.

## Lore
Auramancy is the act of pulling energies out of the Aura and shaping them to some effect. These energies are gathered at the auramancer since they are drawing this energy out. They then shape the energy how they see fit and then must launch that energy out if they wish to hit a target that they are not within reach of. These "spells" have a real travel time and can be dodged by the intended target. The better the auramancer is at their craft, the faster they can send these spells outward, thus making it harder to evade.
