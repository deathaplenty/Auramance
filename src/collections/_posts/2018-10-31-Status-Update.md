Hey! I *am* still working on this project. Don't worry. I just had to slow down because schoolwork started to pile up on me. There's a lot of stuff that still needs to be done before alpha testing, and it's not just new stuff that needs to be added. I often go back over old documents only to realise that I never updated them. So, a large portion of work goes into the maintenance of this wiki. But that's okay: The wiki is the product. Without the wiki, I can't dispense the game in a nice way.


In case you are wondering, I currently have a list of things that need to be done for alpha testing to start. Below is that list, but please remember that it isn't comprehensive. I get distracted with new mechanics a lot...

- All skills need to be done
- Spells need to be done
- Items
- Mechanics need to be finalized
- Small campaign, with enemies and locations


P.S. Happy Halloween!ðŸ‘»
