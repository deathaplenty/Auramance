Demons and Angels are the same thing. They are a type of Fae brought about from strong emotion. They typically have an affinity for whatever emotion bore them, causing many demons and angels to be slaves to emotions that are not their own.

## Available Magic
All


Demons and Angels can be ethereal or corporeal. An ethereal can become corporeal, but not the other way around.
