Not all actions are contests. Sometimes, it might be beneficial if many characters work toward a common goal.

### How this works
1. The GM sets a difficulty for a task as a number between 1 and 20 (higher is more difficult). 
2. Reduce this difficulty by the one less the number of participants. 
3. All participants roll a D20 and apply skill bonuses.
4. The action succeeds if there are more successes than failures.
