Health is a measure of vitality, of how strong a grasp a character has on living. It is a set attribute dependant on species.

## Developer notes
It is my intention that health be more of an indicator of how close to death a character is rather than how "healthy" they are. The only combat effect low health should have should be morale checks, otherwise a character with 1 health should be as capable as a character with 20 health.
