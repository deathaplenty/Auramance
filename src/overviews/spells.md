Spells are a structured and formulaic way to use magical energies. If you have any auramancy capability, then you can use spells directly. If you're more of the kind of adventurer to ask for the aid of the magical creatures nearby (consultation), You will be choosing the spells they can use. The required Auramancy level is also the amount of mana a spell costs. Don't expect strong spells in the early game.

Specific spells aren't planned for this repository. GMs and players should work together to decide what spells are fair.

## Spell Creation
An idea for GMs is to allow characters to experiment with Auramancy. If they produce an effect they like, you can allow them to lock the spell down in written form. The benefit of this would be faster and cheaper spells.


## Experimentation
Use of Auramancy doesn't have to be bound to rigid rules and written instructions. Characters with enough skill should be able to conjure any effect they want within reason.
