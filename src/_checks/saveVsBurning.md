Any time a character is on fire, they may make a saving throw vs burning. If it is successful, they do not stay on fire. If it is not successful, they take damage and must try to roll next turn to put the flames out.

This saving throw is directly impacted by what you are wearing. You are much more likely to be set ablaze if you are wearing cloth than if you are wearing plate.
