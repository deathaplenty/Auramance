The Parry skill represents a character's ability to deflect an attack while also opening up their attacker for an immediate counterattack

# How to perform a parry
If a character wishes to Parry, then both attacker and defender must roll to see who gets a higher roll. Since parrying is more difficult than just moving out of the way of an attack, the attacker gets an advantage in his roll.
1. Defender rolls d20 + P, where P is that character's parry chance
2. Attacker rolls d20 + d6 + O, where O is that character's Offensive skill that they are using for their original attack.
3. The higher roll wins
4. If the Defender wins, he rolls a d20 + O, where O is the offensive skill he wants to use to counterattack. If the roll is 11 or higher, the attack lands. Roll again for damage.
5. If the Attacker wins, the original attack happens as normal.

# Notes
- Two-handed weapons cannot parry.
- A Martial Arts skill of 5 or greater allows parrying without a weapon.
