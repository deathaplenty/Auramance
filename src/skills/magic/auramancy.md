## Lore
Auramancy is the act of pulling energies out of the Aura and shaping them to some effect. These energies are gathered at the auramancer since they are drawing this energy out. They then shape the energy how they see fit and then must launch that energy out if they wish to hit a target that they are not within reach of. These "spells" have a real travel time and can be dodged by the intended target. The better the auramancer is at their craft, the faster they can send these spells outward, thus making it harder to evade.

## Developer Notes
The intention of auramancy is to be less about casting crazy powerful spells and more about giving an adventurer another tool in their arsenal. It is with this intent that I plan to lock healing and ressurection spells behind a high auramancy level. Instead, I hope to make players focus on avoiding damage rather than negating it after the fact. If you, the player, still wish to have access to healing, consider looking into [Consultation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link skills/magic/consultation.md %}) or [Brewing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link skills/utility/brewing.md %}) as that is where I plan to add access to earlier healing.
