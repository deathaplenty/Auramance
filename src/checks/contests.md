Contests are a form of check where opposing parties in an event (such as defender and attacker) roll a d20 modified by applicable skills to determine who wins. Some contests are a little more complex, but most follow this basic formula:

Victor = Higher value of (ContestantA_D20 + ContestantA_skill) and (ContestantB_D20 + ContestantB_skill).
