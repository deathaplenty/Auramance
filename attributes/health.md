Health is a measure of vitality, of how strong a grasp a character has on living. It is a set attribute dependant on species and age. Typical adventurers are young and healthy, but if an older character is desired (much older. 40+ for example for a human), they would incur a health penalty.

Base max health is set at 20. As stated above, this is modified by age and species.

## Modifiers based on age
For now, these are fixed for all species. Later, these may be calculated based on that specie's expected lifespan.

For every twenty years above "young adulthood", subtract 4 health from the character's max.






## Developer notes
It is my intention that health be more of an indicator of how close to death a character is rather than how "healthy" they are. The only combat effect low health should have should be morale checks, otherwise a character with 1 health should be as capable as a character with 20 health.
