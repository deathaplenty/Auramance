I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; still working on this project. Donâ€™t worry. I just had to slow down because schoolwork started to pile up on me. Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff that still needs to be done before alpha testing, and itâ€™s not just new stuff that needs to be added. I often go back over old documents only to realise that I never updated them. So, a large portion of work goes into the maintenance of this wiki. But thatâ€™s okay: The wiki is the product. Without the wiki, I canâ€™t dispense the game in a nice way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you are wondering, I currently have a list of things that need to be done for alpha testing to start. Below is that list, but please remember that it isnâ€™t comprehensive. I get distracted with new mechanics a lotâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All skills need to be done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spells need to be done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Items&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mechanics need to be finalized&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small campaign, with enemies and locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
