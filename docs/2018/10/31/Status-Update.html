    <p>Hey! I <em>am</em> still working on this project. Donâ€™t worry. I just had to slow down because schoolwork started to pile up on me. Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff that still needs to be done before alpha testing, and itâ€™s not just new stuff that needs to be added. I often go back over old documents only to realise that I never updated them. So, a large portion of work goes into the maintenance of this wiki. But thatâ€™s okay: The wiki is the product. Without the wiki, I canâ€™t dispense the game in a nice way.</p>

<p>In case you are wondering, I currently have a list of things that need to be done for alpha testing to start. Below is that list, but please remember that it isnâ€™t comprehensive. I get distracted with new mechanics a lotâ€¦</p>

<ul>
  <li>All skills need to be done</li>
  <li>Spells need to be done</li>
  <li>Items</li>
  <li>Mechanics need to be finalized</li>
  <li>Small campaign, with enemies and locations</li>
</ul>

<p>P.S. Happy Halloween!ðŸ‘»</p>
